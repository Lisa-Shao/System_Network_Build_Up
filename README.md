# System_Network_Build_Up
## Demo programme name: SFL System Network Editor

In this project, we would like to build up an **Interactive Graph Visualization Tool**. It is primarily a JavaScript/Front-End engineering challenge focused on graph theory application.

## OUR aim:
- develop an open-source website to provide interactive, real-time graph editing and versioning for system networks
- solve the reliance on static drawing tools (like Draw.io) for managing complex, evolving system networks

Proposed Solution: a dedicated Front-End Graph Editor (TBD)

## Core Features (Minimum Viable Product):
1. System Network Repository: Establish a foundational data layer by parsing existing SFL networks (from their XML/Draw.io sources) and serializing them into a standardized JSON format suitable for graph rendering.
2. Interactive Graph Visualization: Implement a dedicated rendering engine to display networks with custom SFL-specific layouts (e.g., horizontal/vertical cascading structures).
3. Real-Time CRUD Operations: Enable users to perform live Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on network features (nodes) and system boundaries (edges).
4. Data Export: Provide functionality to download the customized network as a clean, machine-readable JSON file for documentation and further analysis.
